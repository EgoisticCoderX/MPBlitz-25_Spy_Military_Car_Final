# Military Object Detection & Geolocation System üõ°Ô∏è

> This project transforms an ESP32-CAM and an ESP32 with a GPS module into a smart surveillance system. It offers two primary modes of operation: real-time threat detection via a live video stream and manual analysis of user-uploaded images.

In **real-time mode**, the ESP32-CAM streams live footage to a Python Flask server. This server uses a Roboflow AI model to detect military objects. üìπ When an object is detected, the system immediately draws a bounding box around it, displays a probability score, and raises a visual warning. üö® It then fetches the current GPS coordinates from the second ESP32 module, logs the captured frame with its location, and displays it on a captures page. üõ∞Ô∏è

In **manual mode**, a user can upload a static image directly through the web interface. The server will analyze the image using the same Roboflow model, and if a detection is made, the annotated image will be saved and displayed in the captures gallery.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Real-time Video Streaming:** Live video feed from the ESP32-CAM directly to a web interface.
*   **AI-Powered Detection:** Utilizes a Roboflow model for accurate detection of military objects in both live video and static images.
*   **Manual Image Upload:** A dedicated mode for users to upload and analyze their own images for threats.
*   **Geolocation Tagging:** Automatically pairs GPS coordinates with every positive detection from the live stream.
*   **Warning System:** Displays a clear visual warning on the frontend whenever a threat is detected.
*   **Automatic Capture & Logging:** Saves a snapshot of any detected object (from either mode) to a dedicated captures gallery.
*   **Web-Based Frontend:** A user-friendly interface built with Flask and HTML for both the live stream and the captures gallery.
*   **Secure Configuration:** Uses a `.env` file to safely store sensitive information like API keys and device URLs.

## üîå Connection Steps

### 1. ESP32-CAM Setup (For Live Stream)

To upload the `CAM_GPS.ino` sketch, connect the ESP32-CAM to your computer using an FTDI programmer.

| ESP32-CAM Pin | FTDI Programmer Pin |
|:-------------:|:-------------------:|
|      VCC      |         5V          |
|      GND      |         GND         |
|      U0T      |         RXD         |
|      U0R      |         TXD         |

**Important:** Before uploading, you must connect the `IO0` pin to `GND` to put the ESP32-CAM into flashing mode. After the upload is complete, disconnect `IO0` from `GND` for normal operation.

### 2. ESP32 DEV Module + GPS Setup (For Geolocation)

This module is responsible for fetching GPS data.

| ESP32 DEV Pin | GPS Module (NEO-6M) Pin |
|:-------------:|:-----------------------:|
|      5V       |           VCC           |
|      GND      |           GND           |
|  GPIO 16 (RX2)  |           TXD           |
|  GPIO 17 (TX2)  |           RXD           |

This setup uses `HardwareSerial` on pins 16 and 17.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup Guide

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>
Use code with caution.
Step 2: Configure The ESP32 Modules (Arduino)
Install Arduino IDE and add the ESP32 Board URL in File > Preferences.
URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager..., search for esp32 and install it.
Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries..., search for TinyGPS++ and install it.
Open CAM_GPS.ino, update your Wi-Fi credentials (ssid and password), and upload it to the ESP32-CAM board (select "AI Thinker ESP32-CAM" as the board).
Open 32_GPS.ino, update your Wi-Fi credentials, and upload it to your ESP32 DEV Module.
Open the Serial Monitor for both devices to get their IP addresses. You will need these for the .env file.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the System
Power On: (For live mode) Connect both the ESP32-CAM and the ESP32 DEV Module to a power source.
Start the Server: Run the Flask application from your terminal.
Generated bash
python app.py
Use code with caution.
Bash
View the Frontend: Open your web browser and navigate to the address shown in the terminal, usually http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Modes of Operation
Live Stream Detection: The main page will immediately start streaming from the ESP32-CAM. If a military object is detected, a warning will appear, and a snapshot will be automatically sent to the /captures page along with its GPS location.
Manual Upload Mode: On the main page, use the file upload form. Select an image from your computer, give it an optional location tag, and click "Upload and Analyze". You will be redirected to the /captures gallery to see the processed result.
